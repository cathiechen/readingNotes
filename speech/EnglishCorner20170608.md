# Public speech of English Corner

So sad, things didn't go as I supposed... Just speak half of what I prepared...

Actually, this's what I planed to say.

## speech

Hello everyone.

I'm cc from xxx. I'm also the one who study English hard but still not good at it.

I think it's a good time to talk about why EC? First of all, I got nothing else to do on Thursday night anyway. The second reason is much important. That is this EC is attrctive even for people who aren't good at English. I realize my English isn't good since for ever. And it really took curage to attend a English Corner. I still remember the moment I made up my mind to attend EC. To be honestly, I almost scare to death. As scare as right now I guess. Fortunatly, one of my collegue who had attended EC before bring me here. And thanks to him, I meet you guys here. I think that moment is the most brave moment in my last year. And guess what? It totally worth it.

Thanks!

## sum up

Yeah, that is what I supposed to say. But all I remember is "I'm not good at English. Attending EC is the most brave thing I did last year. It worth it". It supposed to be a funny speech. But guess what? I got nerves that moment. 

Keep talking in English! Yeah, tatally worth it!
